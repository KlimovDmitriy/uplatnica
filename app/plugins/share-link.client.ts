/**
 * Shared links: "/#n=…" (see utils/share.ts). The slip is read from the address bar before the app
 * starts, because hydrating a prerendered page briefly replaces the URL with the payload path (no
 * hash) and restores it only after the page has mounted. The generator takes the slip from
 * useSharedSlip() when it mounts. The hash is then dropped through the router, so the router's own
 * URL restore cannot bring it back; links opened later in the same tab go the same way.
